            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The methods for managing the whole, with Safety to the Government, and Ease to the Subject, are very obvious, and any Objections can be fully answer'd, but too long to insert here.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Advantages of this Tax.</head>
               <p>1st, A Gentleman of 800 <hi>l. per annum</hi> paid, or ought to have paid to the 2 <hi>s.</hi> in the pound Land Tax 80 <hi>l.</hi> but in this, which may amount to as much as that did, he pays but for his Eatables of Beef, Mutton, Veal and Lamb; which four kinds, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to a Family Expence, is not above one eighth part of the whole; so, instead of paying for 800 <hi>l.</hi> he pays but for one hundred (and not that, except the whole is expneded) and instead of paying 80 <hi>l.</hi> he pays but 10 <hi>l. per an.</hi> to this Tax; and by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the Government to sell the Hides and Skins at a certain price, will reduce the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manufacture to easie terms, and save considerable in the year in the Leather Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and other Leather Wearables, and encourage the Exportation of the same.</p>
               <p>2d, It cannot fall on Land, for the Butcher will give the same price to the Breeder and Grazier, and be content with the same profit then as now; (for 'tis only the Consumer that pays) and one farthing <hi>per</hi> pound advance on the Carcass will make the Butcher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the loss of the Hide and Skin, and the number of Butchers will oblige them to sell at a reasonable profit, what they deal in being so hazardous to keep.</p>
               <p>3d, That the number of Tanners, and their dependance on their Trades, will induce them to buy, at a reasonable price, which being by this duty reduced to more certainty, will be great incouragement to them, by reason more will be exported than formerly.</p>
               <p>4th, That a great summ will come in weekly, and the whole Years Revenue answer'd into the Exchequer in a few days after the year is expired, whereby a great deal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest will be saved.</p>
               <p>5th, That the Collecting it will be with less charge than any other Duty, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer so great a Fund, by reason it is not liable to such Frauds and Concealments, as some other Revenues are.</p>
               <p>6th, It will be the most equal, for Tradesmen and Foreigners will pay as much as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, proportionable to what they spend.</p>
               <p>It is presum'd, That the number killed, and the value of the Hides and Skins will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a considerable summ more than is here set down.</p>
